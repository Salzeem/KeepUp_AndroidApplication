KeepUp! A student organizer app 

This is an Android Studio project written in Java that helps students stay organized by providing three main features: Appointments, Classes, and Groups. The app allows students to book one-on-one time with their professors, add more classes they are enrolled in, and create groups with their classmates. Additionally, students can use the chat feature within their groups to communicate with their classmates, and professors have the ability to accept or decline appointments.
